  "summary": {
    "description": "This algorithm analyzes non-contrast CT scans of the thorax and predicts the lung cancer risk. The model consists of two modules. The first one is a 3D region proposal network for nodule detection, which outputs all suspicious nodules for a subject. The second one selects the top five nodules based on the detection confidence, evaluates their cancer probabilities and combines them with a leaky noisy-or gate to obtain the probability of lung cancer for the subject",
