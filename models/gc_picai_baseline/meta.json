    "description": "This algorithm predicts a detection map for the likelihood of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) using biparametric MRI (bpMRI). The algorithm ensembles 5-fold cross-validation models that were trained on the PI-CAI: Public Training and Development Dataset v2.0. The detection map is at the same spatial resolution and physical dimensions as the input axial T2-weighted image. This model algorithm was used as a baseline for the PI-CAI challenge hosted on Grand Challenge.",

To predict the likelihood of harboring clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), the transversal T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and high b-value diffusion maps are required. The input sequences should be co-registered or aligned reasonably well and the prostate gland should be localized within a volume of 460 cm³ from the centre coordinate. To train these models, a total of 1500 prostate biparametric MRI (bpMRI) scans paired with human-annotated or AI-derived ISUP ≥ 2 delineations were used.",
